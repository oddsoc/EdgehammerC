## ü§ù Contributing

EdgehammerC is currently a personal learning project, and I **will not be accepting contributions until the book is completed**.  

The primary goal is to follow *Writing a C Compiler* chapter by chapter as a personal challenge. Once all chapters are complete and the core compiler is stable, I will likely be open to external contributions.  

If you are interested in contributing after that point, feel free to open an issue or pull request then!
